# simple-annoying-button
A button that runs away when you try to click it built with vanilla JS and TS.

How to run:
- Open cloned repo in VS Code.
- Install the Live Server extension.
- ![live-server-extension](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/580f812d-7f15-4168-b166-b8d2b83b5045)
- After installing Live Sever, click "Go Live" in the lower right corner of your VS Code window. Please refer to the image below.
- ![live-server-position](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/609bc757-74ef-4b43-b316-1d538c63fb16)
- Your default browser will open with the index.html file.

That's it. 
This is just something I thought about and wanted to try.
I don't know if it's fun to frustrate yourself, but I hope you give it a go.
